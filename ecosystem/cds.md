# The Common Data Service

The Common Data Service (a.k.a. CDS)

## Empty Database
If you are starting with an empty database, you will need to create an organization record for every organization you want to integrate with data. To do this:
1.	Go to the PowerApps site.
2.	On the left, choose Common Data Service. This will expand the list of items below.
3.	In the entity list, find the Organization entity. (The fast way is to use the search control.)
4.	In the details page for the Organization entity choose to “Open in Excel.”
5.	When the Excel spreadsheet opens, choose to “Enable Editing.”
6.	Add an Organization row in the spreadsheet. Use the “Microsoft PowerApps Office Data Connector Add-in to help you put in the required fields. It shows a star “*” by all required fields. And, you can simply choose legal values right in the add-in.
7.	Choose to Publish back into CDS. (The command is located in the bottom of the Data Connector Add-in.)
8.	Double check that the record was written by selecting the Data tab in the PowerApps site.
