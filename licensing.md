## Dynamics 365
For the D&B Optimizer for Microsoft solution you need the Sales application. There are a number of options when buying a dynamics license that will give you this application. For more information see [Pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-ie/pricing/).

** Note: Some of the dynamic 365 plans will give you access to the PowerApps application but this license is not enough to run the D&B Optimizer for Microsoft solution. See PowerApps section below for more details about the right license for PowerApps. **
